# Hey there! 👋 I'm Hadi Rachmat  

🧠 Fullstack Developer | Code Craftsman | Problem Solver  

I love working across the stack — from designing REST APIs with **Express + Prisma**  
to crafting modern UIs with **React + TailwindCSS**.  

🔧 My go-to tools:  
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- Node.js, Express  
- React.js, Ant Design  
- PostgreSQL,MySQL, Prisma ORM  

🌱 Currently exploring:  
- Advanced backend patterns (DDD, SOLID, Clean Architecture)  
- Frontend performance optimization and Advance frontend patterns as (atomic)

✨ Motto: “Write code that’s simple, scalable, and speaks for itself.”
